# Infocenter 

## Inspiration

In a world full of data, access to high-quality financial information is often locked behind expensive paywalls. Students and aspiring professionals with an interest in global markets are at a disadvantage, unable to afford services like Bloomberg, Reuters, or TradingView. **Infocenter** was born out of the desire to democratize access to financial data.

## ðŸš€ What it does

**Infocenter** is an open-source web platform that provides centralized, real-time information on global markets. It's a collaborative space where users can not only consume data but also contribute to the platform by adding new data sources and visualizations. This creates a powerful, community-driven tool that grows and adapts to the users' needs.

## How we built it

This project was built using a combination of technologies to create a robust and scalable platform.

  * **Backend:** Python.
  * **Frontend:** React and tailwind.
  * **Data Sources:** We aim to integrate with various free and public APIs to source our financial data, such as FRED API.

## Challenges we ran into

  * Finding reliable and free financial data APIs.
  * Structuring the project to be easily extensible for new contributors.
  * Finding specific market data 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

  * Successfully setting up the foundational structure of the project.
  * Creating a clear vision for a community-driven financial data platform.
  * (Add any specific accomplishments, like a working prototype or a key feature you've implemented).

## What's next for Infocenter

  * Integration with more data sources (e.g., stock prices, economic indicators, news feeds).
  * User authentication and personalized dashboards.
  * Tools for data visualization and analysis.
  * Building a strong and active contributor community.
